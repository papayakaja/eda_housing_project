### Description

- overview of homes in King County, Washington
- assist a buyer to find a home
- gives info about the condition of houses that their his requirements 
- using Python incl. Pandas, Folium etc.

The short time frame made it somewhat hard to come up with a nice analysis. In future cases I would dig even deeper and give the potential buyer also some options that don't hit their exact requirements but give me more matching data points to work on and analyze. Nonetheless, I enjoyed my first EDA project. :-)


### Setup

I included a requirements file so you can run your forked and cloned repo in a local environment (works on MacOS, other systems may vary).

```
pyenv local 3.11.3
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
